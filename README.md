# UniversityFeedbackSystem
The "University Feedback System" is a full-stack web application that combines front-end and back-end technologies. It employs the Google OAuth API for secure student login through their Gmail accounts. After successful authentication, students access the home page, where they can offer feedback, suggestions, or file anonymous complaints via dedicated routes. Node.js powers the back end, handling server-side operations, while MongoDB Atlas serves as the database for securely storing user-submitted data. To ensure user account security and privacy, the system includes a logout feature. This comprehensive technology stack delivers a robust and user-friendly platform for student feedback management.
